# Memes Generator

This is a basic API-based Memes Generator API, which gives you the freedom to create your own memes at your own will.

Steps to use the API:

* **Choose your favorite meme and hit the Edit Button.**
* **You will then be taken to the Edit page. Hit Add Text there.**
* **Double-click on the text to edit it.**
  - As you double-click, an input field will appear somewhere on the page. Click it and add your text.
* **Double-click again to get the text box back.**
* **Click and drag the text box wherever you want it to be.**
* **Once you are satisfied with the meme, hit the Save Button. This will download the PNG file of the meme to your device.**
